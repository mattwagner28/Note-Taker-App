# Note-Taker-App
Bootcamp homework assignment #11: Modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

# Features
Upon starting the app, the user will be able to enter a note with a title. They can then hit the save icon in the top right corner to save it to their list of notes found on the left side of the app. If a user clicks on one of their previously saved notes from the left side of the app, the note will then again be displayed in the main section of the app.
